Install pygame via Powershell.
Create new game directory.
Create assets folder.
Call libraries/imports pygame, os, time, random.
Load images, group them based on function.
Define main.
In main, define run boolean set to True, FPS, clock.
In main, write while run loop.
Run loop will tick the game clock at FPS and listen for game events, including quit game.
Quitting game returns run = False and ends game.
Define redraw function within main, where images will be updated and refreshed.
BLIT takes image files, aka surfaces, and will draw them at give x,y coordinates.
(Remember that here, 0,0 is top left, not bottom left.)
Call redraw within run loop.
Images like bg that need to be scaled to fit can be scaled when first loaded.
To display text, font needs to be declared.
Declare base class ship from which all other player and game ships will inherit from.
Enter key pressed listener in run while loop for player input.
In player class, masks are used for perfect pixel to pixel collision detection. pygame.mask
In enemy ship class, create a dictionary that will define color variable to color image.
For spawning, create enemies list, and wave_length variable for enemy batches.
Offset is based off of distance between two objects form their top-left coords.
Offset must be calculated for both x and y and may be negative at times because of coords.
